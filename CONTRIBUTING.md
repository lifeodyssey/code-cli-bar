# Contributing to Code CLI Bar

Thanks for helping improve Code CLI Bar. The project is a native macOS menu-bar app
for developers who monitor AI subscription quotas and local usage across
ChatGPT/Codex, Claude Code, Gemini/AntiGravity, Grok, and other coding plans.
Changes should keep those workflows clear, private, fast, and visually
consistent across providers.

## Commit Identity

Use your own git identity — there is no shared maintainer alias. If you want
to keep your personal email out of the public log, configure GitHub's
privacy email (`<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com`) for this repo:

```sh
git config --local user.name  "Your GitHub Name"
git config --local user.email "<id>+<login>@users.noreply.github.com"
```

Do not commit personal emails, machine hostnames, internal handles, or
`/Users/<name>` paths inside source files, fixtures, or logs — that's a
source-content rule, not a commit-author rule.

## Branch and PR Workflow

Start from an up-to-date `main`, then create a topic branch. Use short,
descriptive branch names with conventional prefixes such as
`feat/<topic>`, `fix/<topic>`, `docs/<topic>`, `test/<topic>`,
`refactor/<topic>`, or `release/<topic>`. These prefixes are for branch
names only; commit subjects should stay imperative and should not use
`feat:` / `fix:` / `chore:` prefixes.

If multiple local agents may be working at once, prefer a separate Git
worktree so each branch has its own checkout. If the user has not
explicitly asked about worktrees, choose the safer path and proceed
instead of stopping for confirmation.

Submit changes through a pull request against `main`. Do not push
directly to `main` unless AQ explicitly asks for an emergency direct
push.

## Development Setup

Vibe Bar is a Swift package with two main targets:

- `VibeBarCore`: parsers, storage, privacy helpers, adapters, and usage logic.
- `VibeBarApp`: AppKit/SwiftUI menu-bar app, windows, and UI glue.

Session reading — discovery, per-harness parsing, the FTS5 session index,
deletion planning, harness naming, and the MCP transport — lives in
[`agent-session-kit`](https://github.com/AstroQore/agent-session-kit), a
separate repository with its own releases, pinned here to an exact tag in
`Package.swift` and linked statically. A change there is a change over
there: cut a kit release, then bump the pin. `AGENTS.md` § 2.1 has the
table of what lives where, the bump procedure (by hand and by the daily
`bump-agent-session-kit` workflow), and `swift package edit` for working on
both at once. A kit tag is not a Vibe Bar release — it reaches users only
in a Vibe Bar build.

Before opening a pull request, run:

```sh
swift build
swift test
./Scripts/build_app.sh release
codesign -d --entitlements - ".build/Code CLI Bar.app"
```

Code CLI Bar runs **unsandboxed** so the misc-providers feature can read
browser cookies and probe AntiGravity. The codesign output should be
an empty `<dict/>` plist with no `com.apple.security.app-sandbox` key.
See `AGENTS.md` § 6 for the full reasoning.

## Privacy Rules

- Do not commit real tokens, cookies, JWTs, organization IDs, account IDs, or
  email addresses.
- Do not add `/Users/<name>` paths. Use `/Users/example/...` in fixtures and
  documentation when a home path is needed.
- Do not log raw credentials or email addresses. Use `SafeLog.sanitize` and
  `EmailMasker`.
- New persistent state should go through `VibeBarLocalStore` and live under
  `~/.vibebar/`.
- Vibe Bar runs unsandboxed by design (see `AGENTS.md` § 6), but treat
  the user's filesystem with the same discipline a sandboxed app would:
  read only the credential / cookie / config files you actually need,
  never write outside `~/.vibebar/`, and never log raw secrets.
- There are exactly two exceptions: whole-session deletion through
  `SessionDeleter`, performed only at the user's explicit request and on
  the containment / symlink / re-parsed-session-id terms `AGENTS.md` § 5
  sets out; and the Skills manager, which writes only to
  `~/.agents/skills/` and the allowlisted app skills directories, and
  only through `SkillSyncEngine` / `SkillsService` (`AGENTS.md` § 7).

## Implementation Notes

- Keep heavy logic in `VibeBarCore`; keep UI glue in `VibeBarApp`.
- JSONL scanning must stay linear. Use the moving-cursor style from
  `CostUsageScanner.forEachJSONLLine`.
- Avoid deep `TimelineView(.periodic(...))` trees. Scope live timers to visible
  UI surfaces.
- Keep mini-window geometry in `mini_window_geometry.json` instead of folding it
  into `AppSettings`.
